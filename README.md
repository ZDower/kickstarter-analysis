# Kickstarting with Excel 
The purpose of my project was to clean and analyze Kickstarter data to figure out which theatre production's Kickstarter campaings have the best success rate based on the time of year they launch and their financial backing goal. 
## Overview of Project and Analysis and Challenges
To perform the analysis, I used MS excel to find out what campaigns were successful, failed, and cancelled. I then used MS excel to find out which Kickstarter campaigns had the most success, failures and cancellations based on the month they were started as well as their Kickstarter funding goals. From there I was able to create charts and graphs to analyze what goals / months led to the most success.
### Challenges Faced
A challenge I faced was drawing a legit conclusion from the 'Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date graph'. The 'Theatre Outcomes by Launch Date graph' doesnâ€™t show much about what is going on in those months ie. the quality of the theater show, the Kickstarter goals, the production company, or the backers who help fund. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Louise should launch her Kickstarter campaign in the summer months; May, June and July as the data shows those to be the months with the most success.
January is the worst month to Launch a campaign with only 50% of Kickstarter campaigns resulting in success.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The lower the Kickstarter goal is, the more successful Kickstarters are at securing the funding. 
Louise should set her kickstarter goal between less than $1000 and $10,000 for the best chance of success.
## limitations of this dataset
The limitations of the dataset are that there are a lot of outliers. There are a lot of successful campaigns with goals around $1. These seem to be mistakes or anomalies. Another limitation is that the majority of the data surrounds the lower part of the goals. There is not much data on Kickstarter goals between 15000 and 49999 (only 178 datapoints). Although only accounting for 37% of the Goal categories, goals between less than 1000 and 9999 account for four times as many projects as the rest of the Kickstarter goals which are goals from 10000 and 50000 or greater.
## Other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create
I think an awesome table/ graph to create would be one where we would compare the goal and date. I say this because, although summer months are the most successful for reaching their Kickstarter goals they could also be the months with the highest amount of low Kickstarter goals.
